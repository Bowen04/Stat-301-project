    "#### Summary of findings\n",
    "The R-squared value indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (salary_in_usd) that is predictable from the independent variables. In this context, the R-squared value of 0.4847671 for Ridge Regression means that approximately 48.48% of the variance in salaries can be explained by the predictors used in the model. This is significantly higher than the R-squared values for both the original and selection models, which were 27.97% and 31.18%, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher R-squared in Ridge Regression suggests that the model has improved its ability to explain the variability in the data by effectively balancing the trade-off between bias and variance, reducing the impact of less relevant or noisy features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Possible Improvements\n",
    "Consider more complex models that are non-linear to build the predictive model since relationships between predictors that may not be captured by the linear model."
